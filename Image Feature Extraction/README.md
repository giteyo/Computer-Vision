# Image Feature Extraction
## Overview

This project demonstrates various image feature extraction techniques used in computer vision and image analysis.
It includes both classic descriptors and statistical methods for texture, shape, and intensity analysis.

## Techniques included:

     1. Canny Edge Detection – Detects edges in images.

     2. Harris Corner Detection – Identifies corners.

     3. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) – Dimensionality reduction and reconstruction.

     4. Gabor Filters – Extracts frequency and orientation information.

     5. Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) – Texture analysis based on pixel relationships.

     6. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) – Keypoint detection and descriptors.

     7. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) – Shape and gradient features.

     8. Local Binary Patterns (LBP) – Texture descriptors based on pixel neighborhoods.

     9. Local Directional Patterns (LDP) – Texture descriptors capturing directional edge information.

These features are widely used in image classification, object recognition, medical imaging, and pattern analysis.
